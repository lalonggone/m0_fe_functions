# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

    - I don't think I did great with this lesson. It took a while for me to grasp in the first place and I didn't allocate the time to understand it more fully. I basically ran out of time on this one between work and other life stuff. I thought I understood it while taking the notes but since I waited to apply the knowledge, I think I lost some of it. 
    - I think functions are powerful because they are reusable thoughout a project which just makes life easier. They are also the instructions for what you want the computer to do so that seems really important because I feel like that's essentially the whole point of programming things.
